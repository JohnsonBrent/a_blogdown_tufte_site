In my day job, I work at [International Planning & Research](https://iprcorp.com/) as a project director. I manage teams that solve client market analysis and data science problems. Example engagements include price optimization, share/performance tracking, product portfolio decision-making, prospect identification, customer clustering, text mining, forecasting--and more. Nothing pleases me more than discovering interesting stories from complex data sets and sharing those stories with clients.

This web site contains _some_ of those stories and discoveries. I include some tools, packages, and functions that I've developed and found useful. Some of these are in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook format right here.  Other projects are hosted on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/JohnsonBrent) where I'd appreciate your suggestions (or commits) for improvement. 

When not leaping tall buildings in a single bound I enjoy skiing and full-contact origami.
