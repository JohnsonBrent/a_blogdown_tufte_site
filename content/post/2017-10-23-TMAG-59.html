excerpt: "My presentation at the October 2017 TMAG conference. My coauthor Jaya Ramaprasad (of Microsoft) and I present a method for combining data sources in a way that leverages the strenths of each and minimizes their weakness.  Our estimated results are more accurate than any one single data source."

<p>On October 19 I had the pleasure of presenting at the TMAG organization’s 59th semi-annual meeting. TMAG is the <a href="https://iprcorp.com/industry/">Technology Market Analysis Group</a>–a collection of market researchers and data scientists from technology companies (e.g., Google, Intel, FaceBook, Microsoft, etc.).</p>
<p>I told a story (with my co-author Jaya Ramaprasad of Microsoft) of how Jaya and I combined a variety of data sources to produce one single estimate of Microsoft’s market share in various server software categories. No one single data source was perfect; they all had complimentary flaws (and strengths). But by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling">Hierarchical Bayes</a> (HB) methods we combined the sources so that their weaknesses offset. The finished HB estimates are less biased and more accurate than any one single source on its own. The HB etimates are also more accurate than the maximum likelihood estimator from all the sources.</p>
<p>I don’t have a recording available. Only the slides–which you can get by contacting me.</p>
